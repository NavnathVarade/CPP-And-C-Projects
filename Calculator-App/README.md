# Calculator App

This is a simple calculator application implemented in C++ that supports basic arithmetic operations as well as some scientific functions. It has two modes: normal and scientific, which can be switched using the 'change' keyword. Special keywords such as 'result' and 'mem' are provided for convenience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NavnathVarade/CPP-And-C-Projects.git -b main --single-branch Calculator-App

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Calculator-App

3. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o calculator

4. Run the compiled executable:

    ./calculator

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations and utilize various features of the calculator.

6. Quit the application when done.

## Usage
- Enter numbers and operators to perform calculations.
- Use 'change' to switch between normal and scientific modes.
- Use 'result' to access the last calculated result.
- Use 'mem' to store and recall a number for future calculations.
- Type 'exit' to quit the calculator.
